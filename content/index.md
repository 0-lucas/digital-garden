This is my own **digital garden** for knowledge management. I started it not too long ago, so for now, it's just a handful of notes.

I try not to go too deep into the *Zettelkasten method* or *Second Brain concept*. I just really like summarizing my ideas while I'm studying.

I mostly use Obsidian for note taking during my studies and my notes probably are kind of messy and some half-finished. When deploying to this website, some LaTeX was broken, please, bear with it.

However, if you found this useful, maybe want to download a note, or have anything to tell or ask me, I'd love to talk about it!!

You can reach out to me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/0-lucas) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/llsalmeida/).
