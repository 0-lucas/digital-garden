# What is it?

*Machine Learning* is the science about programming algorithms that can **learn from data**, to improve its **performance** at a given task. It's also a sub-field inside *artificial intelligence*.
___
Quoting some already established authors:

>*Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.* — **Arthur Samuel**, 1959.

A more technical one:

>*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.* — **Tom Mitchell**, 1997.
___

Contrary to what the buzzwords say, *machine learning* has been around for some decades already. *Optical Character Recognition* (OCR) and *e-mail spam detection* are some of the **first applications** that can be considered *machine learning*.
