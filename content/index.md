This is my own *digital garden* for knowledge management.

I try not to go too deep into the Zettelkasten method or Second Brain concept. I just really like summarizing my ideas while I'm studying.

I mostly use obsidian for note taking during my studies and my notes are probably very messy and half-finished. When deploying to a website, some LaTeX was broken, please, just bear it with it.

However, if you find this useful, want to download a .md file, or have anything to tell or ask me, I'd love to talk about it!!

You can reach out to me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/0-lucas) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/llsalmeida/).
