# What is it?
*Differentiation* is a fundamental of [[Calculus]] which studies **rates of change** and **slopes of curves**. It allows determining how a **function's output changes** when its **input changes ever so slightly**. 

Basically, *differentiation* is the **process of finding** the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of a function.

# Differentiation rules

[[Derivatives]] are used to define the **rate of change** and **instantaneous slope at a given point**. But using the definitions takes too much time, so there are some **rules** that help to **find the derivatives** of a function.

## Polynomial and exponential functions

Let's start with the most basic ones, some simple **polynomial functions**, **power functions** and **exponential functions**.
### Constant function

The easiest of all functions, the *constant function*, is given by the general form  $f(x) = c$, meaning that $y = c$. It gives a **straight line** in a graph, with **slope equal to 0**, resulting in a *derivative o* $f'(x) = 0$.
$$
f^{\prime}(x)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{c-c}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} 0=0
$$

### Power function

Functions of the general form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a **positive integer,** are *power functions*. If $n = 1$, then $f(x) = x$, which would result in $f'(x) = 1$.
If $n \neq 1$, we can use the *Power Rule*, which states:
$$
f'(x^n) = nx^{n-1}, \quad x \in \mathbf{R}
$$
This is a **general case**, which can be proven using the definition:

### Exponential functions

*Exponential derivatives* are a very specific. One of the popular forms of an *exponential function* is $f(x)=e^x$, where $e$ is the *Euler's number*, which is its own derivative. For details, check out [this link](https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/derivative-of-exponential-function/).

For functions that follow the general form $f(x) = a^x$, the **derivative of an exponential function** is the **product of the exponential function** $a^x$ and $\ln{a}$, that is:
$$
f'(a^x) = a^x \, \ln{a} \ , \quad  a > 0
$$

## Derivatives between functions

When there are functions in a **sum** and **subtraction** between itself, or **multiplication** by a constant, the **derivatives of the result can be calculated using the old functions**.
### Multiplication by constant

The *Constant Multiplication Rule* states that the **derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function**.
$$
f'(c * x) = c[f'(x)], \quad or \quad \frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)] = c\frac{d}{dx}f(x)
$$

### Sum and substraction of functions

The *Sum Rule* states that **the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of derivatives.** This allows easier calculations when this rule is appliable.
$$
(f(x) + g(x))' = f(x)' + g(x)'

$$

The *Difference Rule* is similar, but works with **subtraction** instead of addition.
$$
(f(x) - g(x))' = f(x)' = g(x)'
$$

### Product and quotient of functions

The *Product Rule* states that **the derivative of a product of two functions** is the **first function times the derivative of the second functions** plus the **second functions times the derivative of the first function**.
$$
\begin{align}

&(f(x) * g(x))' = f(x)*g(x)' + g(x)*f(x)' \\
&or\\
&(fg)' = fg' + gf'
\end{align}
$$

The *Quotient Rule* looks it not as similar to the product rule like sum and subtraction. It states that **the derivative of a quotient is the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator**, which translates to:
$$
\begin{equation}
   \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)
\end{equation}' = \frac{gf' -fg'}{g^2}
$$
___
## Chain Rule

The *Chain Rule* is all about *composite functions*, so functions that depends on the values of other functions. It states that **the derivative of a composite function $F(x) = f(g(x))$ is given by:**
$$
F'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)
$$
