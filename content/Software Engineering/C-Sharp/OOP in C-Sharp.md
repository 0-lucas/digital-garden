# Object-Oriented Programming

[[C-Sharp]] supports every basic principle of [[OOP]] — ***Abstraction***, ***Encapsulation***, ***Inheritance***, ***Polymorphism*** —. 

## Abstraction

This is the process of ***hiding complex details*** and tasks and ***exposing only a simple interface*** for interaction between the user and the complex features, often as a function or method.

## Encapsulation

This is the mechanism of ***restricting access to data and parts of the code***. Each object should **control its own data**, **methods**, and **properties**. Think about what <u>really</u> needs to be exposed and what **should be kept private**.

One way to do this in C# is to use **private fields and manage with** [[Auto Property in C-Sharp|properties]].

## Inheritance

For inheritance, check the note [[Inheritance in C-Sharp]]

## Polymorphism

***Polymorphism*** means <i><u>"the condition of occurring in several different forms"</u></i>. So types in the **same inheritance chain** should be able to **perform different tasks**. So children objects **share functionality,** but it's also able to **define its own implementations**.
