# What is it?

*PCA* stands for *Principal Component Analysis*, being one of the most popular [[Dimensionality Reduction]] algorithms.

# How it works?

The *PCA* algorithm uses the **projection method** described in [[Dimensionality Reduction]] to find the **hyperplane that lies closest to the data**, and then it **projects the data** at the identified hyperplane.
The idea is to select the hyperplane which minimizes the [[MSE|mean squared error]], and preserve the **maximum variance possible.**
