# What is it?

An *Integral* is the main [[Mathematics|mathematical]] concept in [[Integration]], having the same relationship as [[Derivatives]] being the operation of [[Differentiation]]. *Integrals* are heavily used in *analytical geometry* and [[Machine Learning]] for metrics like *ROC-AUC*.

An *integral* is the reverse of a [[Derivatives|derivative]]. In fact, the process of finding the *anti-derivative* of a function is called [[Integration]]. In other words, if you have a derivative $f'(x)$, the original function $f(x)$ is our *anti-derivative*, also called *integrals*.

You can interpret an *integral* as a **continuous sum of infinitesimally small numbers**, used to calculate **curved areas and volumes**. An *integral* is the representation of the **area under a curve of a function**. For example, an *integral* could be used to calculate the area $A(x)$ below:
