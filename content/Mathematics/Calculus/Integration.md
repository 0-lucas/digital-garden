# What is it?

*Integration* is to [[Integrals]] the same [[Differentiation]] is to [[Derivatives]]. Both involve shrink a number down to its infinitesimal scale to calculate something. In the case of *Integration*, they are the about **adding up infinitesimal pieces of something** and **calculating the area under a curve**.

The objective of *integration* is to discover the [[Integrals|integral]] of a function, also commonly named as *anti-derivative* and *primitive function*. In other words, if you have a derivative $f'(x)$, the original function $f(x)$ is our *anti-derivative*, the function *integration* wants to discover.

# How does it work?

Let's start with an example. Given a function $f(x) = x + 1$, we can calculate the *integral*, using the same logic we used in [[Differentiation]]:
$$
\begin{align}

&f(x) = x + 1

\end{align}
$$
