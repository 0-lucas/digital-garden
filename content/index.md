title: Welcome to Quartz 4
---

Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [[showcase|already using Quartz]] to publish personal notes, wikis, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) to the web.

## ðŸª´ Get Started

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
git checkout v4-alpha
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once you've done so, see how to [[build]] and [[hosting|host]] Quartz.
