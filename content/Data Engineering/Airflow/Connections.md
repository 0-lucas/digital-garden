*Connections* in [[Apache Airflow]] are used for **storing credentials** and **parameters** used for connecting with external services. 

They can be defined as *environment variables* in the Airflow [[Docker]] image, or inside the *Web Server*, using the user interface. 

>*A list of all managed connections can be found in the [official documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/core-extensions/connections.html).*

# Creating connections in Airflow

This is the interface for listing all defined connections:

![[Connections List.png]] 

Let's delve deeper into the *MySQL* connection, for example. Here, we can define the **ID**, which will be used inside the *DAG* for referencing the connection. Other information are dependent on the *Connection Type*. This could be referring to **database or API credentials**, **URLs**, and other specific information.

# Referencing connections in DAG

To reference the *connection* in **Python code**, just use the same **connection ID** defined in the *Web Server* in the *DAG* or *Operator* parameters.

```python
# Task-based reference
task = MySqlOperator(
	task_id="dummy_task",
	sql="SELECT * FROM table",
	mysql_conn_id="mysql") # Specifying the connection defined in Airflow

# DAG-based reference using default arguments.
default_args = {
    "owner": "lucas",
    "start_date": datetime(2024, 2, 25), 
    "mysql_conn_id": "mysql", # Specifying the connection defined in Airflow
}

with DAG(
    dag_id="dummy_dag",
    schedule_interval=None,
    default_args=default_args,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
	pass
```
