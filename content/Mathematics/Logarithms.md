# What is it?

A *logarithm* is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] concept that can be expressed as the **exponential relationship** between numbers. Basically, the *logarithm* of a number is the **exponent** at which should we **elevate the base number** until results in the number itself. 
> *So, $\log_{2} 8 = 3$, because $2^3 = 8$.*

# Logarithmic specifics

There are two **specific logarithms**, which have their own names:

- $log_e$ is called the *natural logarithm*, written as $\ln$.

- $log_{10}$ is called the *common logarithm*, written with **no base**, only as $\log$.

Apart from that, there are also some **logarithm properties** that can help to calculate some equations:

- $\log_{c} 1 = 0$

- $log_{c}c = 1$

- $\log_{c} (\frac{a}{b}) = \log_c{a} - \log_c{b}$

- $\log_c a^b = b*\log_c a$

 - $log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}$

- $log_a a^b = b$

- $a^{\log_a b} = b$

# Logarithm function

A *logarithm* function is the **inverse of an exponential function**. You can transform an exponential function into a *logarithm* one and they would mirror each other:
