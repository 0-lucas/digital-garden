# What is it?

For a given [[Machine Learning]] model, it's possible for the loss of a **specific subpopulation** of the data to be **significantly higher** than the rest of the dataset. For example, *Generative AI* is known to have issues in human-centric data, like race, gender and socio-economical factors, i.e., some races may perform better in facial recognition than others.

A model prediction **should not depend on which subpopulation a data point belongs to**, and needs to be able to generalize proportionally well across the **entire distribution.**

This is different from [[Class Imbalance]], where it focus is on the **target variable**. Here the focus is on the **features itself**.

# Discovering underperforming samples

It may not be easy to identify the **characteristics of the underperforming subpopulation**, so one should be able to **strategize ways to find these subgroups** where the model underperform, most commonly, using [[Data-Centric Evaluation]] methods.

A common strategy is ***error analysis*** and ***clustering***, i.e., ***Slice Discovery***
### Error Analysis

Evaluate your model using **validation data**, and sort the examples by **loss value**, which would be the ones where the model is performing poorly. Then try to **identify** any **patterns**, **mislabels** or **noisy data**.
### Error Clustering

Apply ***clustering techniques*** only to the examples identified by the step above, and figure out **subgroups** and **patterns** among the examples.

[Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) can be done by applying a single distance metric between two examples, using *unsupervised learning*. **Plotting and inspecting the resulting clusters** can expose **patterns** the model struggles to capture. 

> *It's also possible to make this method be label-aware, instead of unsupervised. Which is done by using **SDMs**.*
### Slice Discovery Methods â€” SDMs

*Slice Discovery* is the task of mining input data for meaningful subpopulations on which the model performs poorly. Any automated technique that performs this task can be called a **Slice Discovery Method**.

# Improving model performance

Here are some ways to improve model performance for a specific sample:
- ##### Trying a more flexible model;
- ##### Over-sample or up-weight the subpopulation;
- ##### Collect additional data;
- ##### Measure or engineer extra features for the specific sample.
- ##### Use [[Fairness Metrics]] for evaluation.
