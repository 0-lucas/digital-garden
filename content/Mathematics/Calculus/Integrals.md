# What is it?

An *Integral* is the main [[Mathematics|mathematical]] concept in [[Integration]], having the same relationship as [[Derivatives]] being the operation of [[Differentiation]]. *Integrals* are heavily used in *analytical geometry* and [[Machine Learning]] for metrics like *ROC-AUC*.

An *integral* is the reverse of a [[Derivatives|derivative]]. In fact, the process of finding the *anti-derivative* of a function is called [[Integration]]. In other words, if you have a derivative $f'(x)$, the original function $f(x)$ is our *anti-derivative*, also called *integrals*.

You can interpret an *integral* as a **continuous sum of infinitesimally small numbers**, used to calculate **curved areas and volumes**. An *integral* is the representation of the **area under a curve of a function**. For example, an *integral* could be used to calculate the area $A(x)$ below:

# Notation and Definition

The exact definition of a *integral* is the **function of the area bounded by a curve, the x-axis and two points that limit the area**. 

So, given a function $f$ **defined** for $a \leq x \leq b$, we can **divide the interval** $[a, b]$ into **infinite** $n$ sub-intervals of width $\Delta x = \frac{(b - a)}{n}$. Taking $x{_i}{^*}$ as **any sample point** in the sub-intervals, **the *definite integral* of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ is**:

$$
\begin{align}

&\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = \lim _{n \to \infty} \sum _{i = 1}^{n}f(x{_i}{^*})\Delta x 
\\ \\ 
&\text{where}
\\ \\
&\Delta x = \frac{b -a}{b} \quad \text{and} \quad x_i = a + i \Delta x
\end{align}
$$

The symbol $\int$ was introduced by [*Leibniz*](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), and is called the *integral sign*. The elongated *S* represents the **limit of sums**. In the notation above, $f(x)$ is called the *integrand*, which is the **function to integrate**. The points $a$ and $b$ are the *limits of integration*. $dx$ implies that the **independent variable** which will be *"sliced"* is  $x$.

# Finding the approximate area

To find the **approximate area under the curve**, like the image above, one could use **rectangles** that **follow the shape of the curve** to **estimate** the value of the area. 

This method is called [[Riemann Sum]], which consists of any **approximating sum made up of rectangles** of equal or unequal width. You may use this method if [[Integration]] proves to be overkill for the context.

# Finding the exact area

To find the **exact area under a curve**, one could just apply a limit to an existing [[Riemann Sum]]. Well, actually, an *integral* is the limit of a [[Riemann Sum]] when the **width of rectangles tends to zero** and the **number of rectangles tends to infinity**. This gives us the *definite integral*:
$$
\int_a^b f(x)dx = \lim_{n \to \infty}

\sum _{i=1}^n \begin{equation}  \left[f(x_i) * \frac{b-a}{n}\right]  \end{equation}
