# What is it?

*Class imbalance* is when some **classes in the dataset are heavily more prevalent than others**. These can happens because of the **nature of the problem**, or maybe bad data acquisition. This is a **problem in the training data itself**, not the model, which then justifies using [[Mutual Information]] and [[Data-Centric AI]] methods for combating it.

So, for example, *fraud detection* tasks normally present **very imbalanced classes** in the dataset, because of the **nature of the problem**, where fraudulent transactions are way **less common** than normal ones.

Still, *class imbalance* is different from [[Underperforming Subpopulations]]. The latter focuses on the **features of a dataset and how they affect the model**, where *class imbalance* focuses on the **distribution of the target variable**.
