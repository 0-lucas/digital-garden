bAn *asymptote* is a line that a **function approaches, but never quite reaches it**, in other words, **the distance** between **the function and *asymptote*** **tends to zero** as the **function tends to infinite**.
There are three types of *asymptotes*:

# Solving a Horizontal Asymptote

Given a function:
$$f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 3}{x^2 + 1}$$one could **discover its *asymptote*** using the following rules:

- When the numerator degree **is less** than the denominator degree, the horizontal **asymptote is the x-axis** — $y = 0$.
- When the degrees **are equal**, the horizontal asymptote is the **ratio of the leading coefficients**.

So, in this example, the numerator and denominator degrees are equal *— both are squared —*, resulting in:
$$\lim_{{x \to \, \pm\infty}} \frac{2x^2 + 3}{x^2 + 1} = 2 \quad$$

# Solving a Vertical Asymptote
A *vertical asymptote* happens when the denominator of a function **becomes zero**.
So, to find it, just **calculate the zero of the denominator**.

Given the function:
$$
f(x) = \frac{5}{x^2}
$$
Would result in:
$$
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{5}{x^2} = \infty
$$
