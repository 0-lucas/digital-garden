Described in 1809, by the Italian mathematician *Paolo Ruffini*, the *Ruffini's Rule* is a method for **division of polynomials**. It can also be used for finding the **roots of a polynomial**.

# Finding the root of a cubic polynomial

One could use the *ruffini's rule* to lower the degree of a polynomial until it becomes easier to solve, while also discovering the **roots**.
Given an equation:
$$
p(x) = x^3 - 6x^2h + 11x - 6
$$One could guesstimate one root using the ***Rational Root Theorem***,
