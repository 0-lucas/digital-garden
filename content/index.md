This is my own **digital garden** for knowledge management. I started it not too long ago, so for now, it's just a handful of notes.

I don't really apply the Zettelkasten method or any other systematic way of making notes . I just really like summarizing my ideas while I'm studying and use for consulting later.

I mostly use Obsidian for note taking during my studies and my notes probably are kind of messy and some half-finished and even when deploying to this website, some LaTeX was broken. So, things here are really still taking shape and in progress.

However, if you found this useful, maybe want to download a note, or have anything to tell or ask me, I'd love to talk about it!!

You can reach out to me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/0-lucas) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/llsalmeida/).
