> Wondering why Mermaid diagrams may not be showing up even if you have them enabled? You may need to reorder your plugins so that `Plugin.ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown()` is _after_ `Plugin.SyntaxHighlighting()`.

```mermaid

    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
