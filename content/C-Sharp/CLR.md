# CLR â€” Common Language Runtime

The **CLR** is the **Virtual Machine** component that manages the execution of *.NET* supported code. Most commonly used with [[C-Sharp]].

After receiving the compiled *binary encoded* C# code, the CLR will handle:
- Just-in-Time compiling;
- Code management at run time;
- Garbage collector/ Memory management;
- Handle exceptions and type safety;
- Instance of C# to call methods from another .NET language, like F#.
